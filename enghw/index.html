      <p><strong>What did you learn about Romeo and Juliet that you didn't know about the play and storyline before having it assigned to you in this class? How did this enhance your understanding of the storyline and the play?</strong></p>
      <p>I learned quite a bit about Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>: the basic plot, the less-basic character motivations, Shakespeare&rsquo;s time period, and more old English than I expected.</p>
      <p>Firstly, I learned the foundational plot of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. This is great because it provides me access to the many references to <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> in other literature and arts. Although many of the references are merely referring to basic details in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, much literature uses these basic references to invoke something greater. In this way, a basic understanding of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> enables me to appreciate many more complex references.</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s like learning to read: to appreciate books, reading has to become easy. A basic understanding of how to read can help enormously in learning far from basic content.</p>
      <p>The play <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is a cornerstone of English literature, in that it is so widely known, and so frequently referenced. The truth that I hadn't read or even seen <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> before was frankly unacceptable, so I&rsquo;m glad we took the time to go over it. Knowing just the basic understanding of the plot is going to serve me well.</p>
      <p>Aside from just a basic understanding of the play, we also learned of the in-depth motivations of characters, which was helpful in growing a comprehensive understanding of the play and gaining some more edification out of it. Understanding a character's motivations is really helpful in understanding why they did something, and understanding why is very important.</p>
      <p>We also went over Elizebethean theater: how Shakespeare would present this play in his time and what that would be like. This also helps with the &ldquo;why,&rdquo; because many aspects of the play were included for reasons other than the improvement of the story. For example, the prologue was to help the groundlings gain a better understanding of what they were about to watch. The scene with the musicians and Peter was there to provide comic relief to the audience but really didn&rsquo;t add anything to the plot. These parts of the play would really have confused me if we didn&rsquo;t go over why they were there.</p>
      <p>Lastly, I learned old English. Starting out, it sounded really strange, but by the end, it wasn&rsquo;t as strange because I had gotten used to it. Because we were required to fully understand some parts of the play, I had no choice but to learn words like art, doth, and hath along with strange sentence structures which ultimately helped me understand the rest of the play.</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s no wonder that <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is so popular: it&rsquo;s a very moving, interesting play. Because of its popularity, it is referenced in many other works, which is why I&rsquo;m glad we had a chance to go over it and learn so many of its complexities.</p>

      <p>4.5 starts off early in the morning. It&rsquo;s Wednesday, the day of Juliet&rsquo;s marriage, so Capulet sends the Nurse to wake Juliet and prepare her. However, after the nurse enters the room and chides Juliet for sleeping so excessively long, she discovers that Juliet is in fact dead. After she makes this grave discovery, the mood of the play turns around 180 degrees, as it so often does in the Capulet household. The nurse was initially joking around with her characteristically bawdy humor, but when she discovered Juliet's apparent death, the mood changed from excited anticipation into shocked sorrow.</p>
      <p>The nurse then calls for help, so Lady Capulet hurries inside. Noticing that Juliet is dead, she starts mourning her death and says that she may die too. Then Capulet runs into the room, and the three of them dramatically mourn Juliet&rsquo;s loss until Friar Lawrence and Paris arrive and hear the news. Capulet is perhaps most eloquent in this scene: &ldquo;Death lies on her like untimely frost / Upon the sweetest flower of all the field&rdquo; (4.5.33-34). Their exaggerated reactions are in stark contrast to the seriousness of Juliet&rsquo;s death, suggesting that they are false. Although sometimes disasters can cause violent reactions, the Capulets&rsquo; are clearly being disingenuous.</p>
      <p>Paris is shocked and devastated to hear the news, and joins in with the weeping and mourning, although he is more genuine. However, Friar Lawrence cannot do likewise, because he knows of Juliet's plan and knows that she isn&rsquo;t really dead. Friar Lawrence tries to console all of them by telling them that Juliet is in heaven, and that&rsquo;s what they wanted anyway: for Juliet to be in a better place. He arranges for the wedding preparations to be changed into funeral arrangements as the rest continue mourning.</p>
      <p>At the end of this scene, there is an exchange between Peter, a Capulet serving-man, and some musicians. Peter asks the musicians to play him a song, but they refuse, not willing to jeopardize a free meal. The musicians tell Peter to go away, and then they decide to stay for the funeral feast. Sometimes this part of the play is not performed because it is not considered to be especially important to the plot.</p>
      <p>The most important aspect of the scene is the cancellation of the funeral and the revelation that Juliet has &ldquo;died;'' this will have an impact on the rest of the play when Romeo tragically discovers far too early that Juliet is dead, and comes back to Verona to die at Juliet&rsquo;s side. This scene also gives readers the chance to get to know the Capulets&rsquo; a bit better as they respond to their daughter&rsquo;s death.</p>

      <p><strong>Make a VERY SPECIFIC CONNECTION between <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> and another text that we read throughout the entire school year (may be a poem, short story, novel, etc.).</strong></p>
      <p>We&rsquo;ve explored a lot of literature over the year, but the first related work that comes to my mind when thinking about <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is <em>The Poet X</em>. Both of these texts explore aspects of teenagers including family expectations, love, and identity. In <em>The Poet X</em>, Xiomara is coming to terms with her identity and learning about love while also faced with crippling expectations from her mother. In <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, something very similar is happening: two young lovers are trying to figure out how to be together despite disapproval from both of their families. The overarching theme, however, across these two stories is youth.</p>
      <p>Firstly, both literary works have parent expectations that prevent teenagers from getting what they want. In <em>The Poet X</em>, Xiomara&rsquo;s mom thinks that she should go to church and be more like a woman, and in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, Capulet expects Juliet to marry this respectable man named Paris, even though she doesn&rsquo;t want to. These family expectations really shape how not only Romeo but also Xiomara act in the story. In <em>The Poet X</em>, Xiomara finally breaks and declares independence from her mother, and in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, Juliet tries in her own way to achieve independence, by feigning her death.</p>
      <p>Another theme that is constant between the two stories is that of teenage love. Xiomara meets Aman, while Juliet meets Romeo. As a result, there are many smaller details that also remain the same. For example, Aman&rsquo;s impulsiveness with Xiomara at his house is very similar to Romeo&rsquo;s characteristic impulsiveness. However, there is one interesting distinction: in the modern text <em>The Poet</em> X, Xiomara tells Aman to slow down with his love and he listens but in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, Juliet isn&rsquo;t able to do the same.</p>
      <p>Finally, both stories include teenage independence. In <em>The Poet X</em>, Xiomara goes to Aman&rsquo;s house all by herself because she is mad with her mother and her constant pressure. This is very similar to Juliet going to Friar Lawrence&rsquo;s house for guidance and escape from her father's pressure. Both characters had agency and took their own steps to fix their individual problems.</p>
      <p>Both stories have many similarities, and that&rsquo;s partly because both deal with very similar types of people. Ultimately, regardless of the time period, ethnicity, or gender, teenagers are always going to be the same.</p>

      <p><strong>Which SPECIFIC CHARACTER from the play <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is MOST TO BLAME and is MOST RESPONSIBLE for the tragedies within the entire play and how the events take place? Explain in detail and provide evidence to justify and support your response.</strong></p>
      <p>Friar Lawrence is most to blame for the demise of Romeo and Juliet. Throughout the play, he consistently made the big decisions and told the pair what to do. He furthermore did not make the best decisions because he was impaired by selfishness.</p>
      <p>Firstly, Friar Lawrence made the major decision of wedding Romeo and Juliet. This was the first irreversible decision that happened in the play; some kissing could be forgotten about, but marriage is much more permanent. Friar Lawrence also failed to consider the ramifications that could and would arise out of his decision. Romeo and Juliet, in their youth, weren&rsquo;t able to think through all the possible complications, but Friar Lawrence as the oldest knew of and ignored them. Part of the reason he allowed them to make such a bad decision was that he had his own motive for their marriage. Friar Lawrence hated the conflict in Verona, and he thought that marrying the two would help with this citywide problem.</p>
      <p>The second, and the most unforgivable mistake was Friar Lawrence&rsquo;s plan to get Juliet out of her marriage with Paris. Friar Lawrence had already miscalculated and ignored the possibility of Juliet getting married for real. At this point, he was worried that the families would discover his questionable decision to marry them. Eventually, he comes up with a very dangerous plan and does not take much time to consider the consequences. He exploits Juliet&rsquo;s uncertainty and agitation to push this plan that is not completely sound. All the while, Friar Lawrence still hopes he will achieve his goal of peace in Verona, even though ironically he is causing more bloodshed.</p>
      <p>In the end, Friar Lawrence is completely forgiven by Prince Escalus, even though he himself admits that he was most guilty to Escalus: &ldquo;and here I stand, both to impeach and purge&rdquo; (5.3.235). Escalus blames the two families for the death instead. However, because Friar Lawrence made the major decisions for them, he was responsible for their deaths.</p>

      <p>The Starry Night Over the Rhone - Vincent Van Gogh</p>
      <p>The painting I chose is Vincent Van Gogh&rsquo;s <em>The Starry Night Over the Rhone</em>. I chose this painting because of the stars, which are referenced frequently throughout <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, and also because of the two lovers sitting next to the Rhone river.</p>
      <p>Firstly, in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, stars are very important in representing Romeo and Juliet&rsquo;s love. They are a symbol of beauty, which is why Juliet compares Romeo&rsquo;s eyes to two stars in the famous balcony scene, but Shakespeare&rsquo;s stars also allude to romantic activity in the night, which is more than just beauty. Another important interpretation of stars is fate, which is quite fitting for <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. Right at the beginning of the play, in the prologue, Shakespeare announces Romeo and Juliet as star-crossed lovers, meaning that fate brought them together. The concept of fate is tremendously important to <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> and is what caused the play to be a tragedy rather than just a love story.</p>
      <p>Not only are stars important in Shakespeare&rsquo;s work, but they were also a specialty of Vincent Van Gogh, and he played around with painting the night sky, most notably in his masterpiece: <em>The Starry Night</em>.</p>
      <p>Another reference to <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is the two lovers sitting on the shore. Verona, as it turns out, has a river running through it, the river Adige. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine Romeo and Juliet sitting on the bank of the Adige river staring at the stars as they have done before. The two people on the shore are a clear reference to love, the main part of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>.</p>
