<hr /><strong>What did you learn about Romeo and Juliet that you didn't know about the play and storyline before having it assigned to you in this class? How did this enhance your understanding of the storyline and the play?</strong>
<p>I learned quite a bit about Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet: the basic plot, the less-basic character motivations, Shakespeare’s time period, and more old English than I expected.</p>
<p>Firstly, I learned the foundational plot of Romeo and Juliet. This is great because it enables me to understand the various references to Romeo and Juliet in other literature or arts. Although many of the references are merely referring to basic details in Romeo and Juliet, that doesn’t mean that the art referencing Romeo and Juliet is basic. In fact, many works of art and literature use these basic references to invoke something greater. In this way, a basic understanding of Romeo and Juliet enables me to appreciate more complex references.</p>
<p>It’s like learning to read: to appreciate books, reading has to become easy. A basic understanding of how to read can help enormously in learning far-from basic content.</p>
<p>The play Romeo and Juliet is a cornerstone of English literature, in that it is so widely known, and so frequently referenced. The truth that I hadn't read or even seen Romeo and Juliet before was frankly unacceptable, so I’m glad we took the time to go over it. Knowing just the basic understanding of the plot is going to serve me well.</p>
<p>Aside from just a basic understanding of the play, we also learned of the in-depth motivations of characters, which was helpful in growing a comprehensive understanding of the play, and gaining some more edification out of it. Understanding a character's motivations is really helpful in understanding why they did something, and understanding why is very important.</p>
<p>We also went over Elizebethean theater: how Shakespeare would present this play in his time and what that would be like. This also helps with the “why,” because many aspects of the play were included for reasons other than the improvement of the story. For example, the prologue was to help the groundlings gain a better understanding of what they were about to watch. The scene with the musicians and Peter was there to provide comic relief to the audience but really didn’t add anything to the plot. These parts of the play would really have confused me if we didn’t go over why they were there. Scenes like this help remind you that this play was intended to be presented in a specific medium.</p>
<p>Lastly, I learned old english. Starting out, it sounded really strange, but by the end, it wasn’t as strange because I had gotten used to it. Because we were required to fully understand some parts of the play, I had no choice but to learn words like art, doth, and hath along with strange sentence structures which ultimately helped me understand the rest of the play.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that Romeo and Juliet is so popular: it’s a very moving, interesting play. I’m glad we had a chance to go over it and learn so many of its complexities.</p>
