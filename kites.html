      <h1>History of the Kite</h1>
      <h2>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kite">Wikipedia</a> as filler text.</h2>
      <p>A kite is a tethered heavier-than-air or lighter-than-air craft with
        wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag forces.
         A kite consists of wings, tethers and anchors. Kites often have a
         bridle and tail to guide the face of the kite so the wind can lift it.
          Some kite designs don’t need a bridle; box kites can have a single
          attachment point. A kite may have fixed or moving anchors that can
          balance the kite. One technical definition is that a kite is “a
          collection of tether-coupled wing sets“.
           The name derives from its resemblance to a hovering bird.</p>
      <p>The lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air
        moves around the kite's surface, producing low pressure above and
        high pressure below the wings. The interaction with the wind also
        generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind. The
        resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is
        opposed by the tension of one or more of the lines or tethers to which
        the kite is attached. The anchor point of the kite line may be static
        or moving (e.g., the towing of a kite by a running person,
        boat, free-falling anchors as in paragliders and fugitive
        parakites or vehicle).</p>
      <p>The same principles of fluid flow apply in liquids, so kites can
        be used in underwater currents, but there are no everyday uses as yet.</p>
      <p>Man-lifting kites were made for reconnaissance, entertainment
        and during development of the first practical aircraft, the biplane. </p>
      <p>Kites have a long and varied history and many different types are
        flown individually and at festivals worldwide. Kites may be flown
        for recreation, art or other practical uses. Sport kites can be flown
        in aerial ballet, sometimes as part of a competition. Power kites are
        multi-line steerable kites designed to generate large forces which
        can be used to power activities such as kite surfing, kite landboarding,
         kite buggying and snow kiting. </p>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>Kites were invented in Asia, though their exact origin can only be
        speculated. The oldest depiction of a kite is from a mesolithic period
        cave painting in Muna island, southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, which
        has been dated from 9500–9000 years B.C. It depicts a type of
        kite called kaghati [id], which are still used by modern Muna people.
         The kite is made from kolope (forest tuber) leaf for the mainsail,
         bamboo skin as the frame, and twisted forest pineapple fiber as rope,
         though modern kites use string.</p>
      <p>In China, the kite has been claimed as the invention of the 5th-century
        BC Chinese philosophers Mozi (also Mo Di, or Mo Ti) and Lu Ban
        (also Gongshu Ban, or Kungshu Phan). Materials ideal for kite
        building were readily available including silk fabric for sail
        material; fine, high-tensile-strength silk for flying line; and
         resilient bamboo for a strong, lightweight framework. By 549
         AD paper kites were certainly being flown, as it was recorded
         that in that year a paper kite was used as a message for a rescue
         mission. Ancient and medieval Chinese sources describe kites being
          used for measuring distances, testing the wind, lifting men,
          signaling, and communication for military operations.
          The earliest known Chinese kites were flat (not bowed)
          and often rectangular. Later, tailless kites incorporated
          a stabilizing bowline. Kites were decorated with mythological
           motifs and legendary figures; some were fitted with strings
           and whistles to make musical sounds while flying.</p>
