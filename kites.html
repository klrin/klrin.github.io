      <h1>History of the Kite</h1>
      <h2>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kite">Wikipedia</a> as filler text.</h2>
      <p>A kite is a tethered heavier-than-air or lighter-than-air craft with
      wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag forces.
      A kite consists of wings, tethers and anchors. Kites often have a
      bridle and tail to guide the face of the kite so the wind can lift it.
      Some kite designs don’t need a bridle; box kites can have a single
      attachment point. A kite may have fixed or moving anchors that can
      balance the kite. One technical definition is that a kite is “a
      collection of tether-coupled wing sets“. The name derives from its
      resemblance to a hovering bird.</p>
      <p>The lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air
      moves around the kite's surface, producing low pressure above and
      high pressure below the wings. The interaction with the wind also
      generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind. The
      resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is
      opposed by the tension of one or more of the lines or tethers to which
      the kite is attached. The anchor point of the kite line may be static
      or moving (e.g., the towing of a kite by a running person,
      boat, free-falling anchors as in paragliders and fugitive
      parakites or vehicle).</p>
      <p>The same principles of fluid flow apply in liquids, so kites can
      be used in underwater currents, but there are no everyday uses as yet.</p>
      <p>Man-lifting kites were made for reconnaissance, entertainment
      and during development of the first practical aircraft, the biplane. </p>
      <p>Kites have a long and varied history and many different types are
      flown individually and at festivals worldwide. Kites may be flown
      for recreation, art or other practical uses. Sport kites can be flown
      in aerial ballet, sometimes as part of a competition. Power kites are
      multi-line steerable kites designed to generate large forces which
      can be used to power activities such as kite surfing, kite landboarding,
       kite buggying and snow kiting. </p>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>Kites were invented in Asia, though their exact origin can only be
      speculated. The oldest depiction of a kite is from a mesolithic period
      cave painting in Muna island, southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, which
      has been dated from 9500–9000 years B.C. It depicts a type of
      kite called kaghati [id], which are still used by modern Muna people.
      The kite is made from kolope (forest tuber) leaf for the mainsail,
      bamboo skin as the frame, and twisted forest pineapple fiber as rope,
      though modern kites use string.</p>
      <p>In China, the kite has been claimed as the invention of the 5th-century
      BC Chinese philosophers Mozi (also Mo Di, or Mo Ti) and Lu Ban
      (also Gongshu Ban, or Kungshu Phan). Materials ideal for kite
      building were readily available including silk fabric for sail
      material; fine, high-tensile-strength silk for flying line; and
      resilient bamboo for a strong, lightweight framework. By 549
      AD paper kites were certainly being flown, as it was recorded
      that in that year a paper kite was used as a message for a rescue
      mission. Ancient and medieval Chinese sources describe kites being
      used for measuring distances, testing the wind, lifting men,
      signaling, and communication for military operations.
      The earliest known Chinese kites were flat (not bowed)
      and often rectangular. Later, tailless kites incorporated
      a stabilizing bowline. Kites were decorated with mythological
      motifs and legendary figures; some were fitted with strings
      and whistles to make musical sounds while flying.</p>
      <p>After its introduction into India, the kite further evolved into the
      fighter kite, known as the patang in India, where thousands are flown
      every year on festivals such as Makar Sankranti.</p>
      <p>Kites were known throughout Polynesia, as far as New Zealand, with the
      assumption being that the knowledge diffused from China along with the people.
      Anthropomorphic kites made from cloth and wood were used in religious
      ceremonies to send prayers to the gods. Polynesian kite traditions are
      used by anthropologists to get an idea of early "primitive" Asian traditions
      that are believed to have at one time existed in Asia.</p>
      <p>Kites were late to arrive in Europe, although windsock-like banners
      were known and used by the Romans. Stories of kites were first brought to
      Europe by Marco Polo towards the end of the 13th century, and kites were
      brought back by sailors from Japan and Malaysia in the 16th and 17th centuries.
      Konrad Kyeser described dragon kites in Bellifortis about 1400 AD.
      Although kites were initially regarded as mere curiosities, by the 18th
      and 19th centuries they were being used as vehicles for scientific research.</p>
      <p>In 1752, Benjamin Franklin published an account of a kite experiment
      to prove that lightning was caused by electricity. </p>
      <p>Kites were also instrumental in the research of the Wright brothers,
      and others, as they developed the first airplane in the late 1800s.
      Several different designs of man-lifting kites were developed. The
      period from 1860 to about 1910 became the European "golden age of kiting".</p>
      <p>In the 20th century, many new kite designs were developed. These
      included Eddy's tailless diamond, the tetrahedral kite, the Rogallo
      wing, the sled kite, the parafoil, and power kites. Kites were used
      for scientific purposes, especially in meteorology, aeronautics,
      wireless communications and photography. The Rogallo wing was adapted
      for stunt kites and hang gliding and the parafoil was adapted for
      parachuting and paragliding. </p>
      <p>The rapid development of mechanically powered aircraft diminished
      interest in kites. World War II saw a limited use of kites for military
      purposes (survival radio, Focke Achgelis Fa 330, military radio antenna
      kites).</p>
      <p>Kites are now mostly used for recreation. Lightweight synthetic
      materials (ripstop nylon, plastic film, carbon fiber tube and rod) are
      used for kite making. Synthetic rope and cord (nylon, polyethylene,
      kevlar and dyneema) are used as bridle and kite line. </p>
