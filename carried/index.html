        <h2>Things They Carried Story</h2>
        <p>You'll walk past them in the halls.</p>
        <p>Some are like spin-offs, duplicates--straight from a mold. Those who sit in the cafeteria long before school starts, applying makeup, checking in a mirror. Those who go to the gym and carefully choose their clothes so that they can saunter through campus, trying to look as big and strong as possible. All those who wear pastel sweaters and carefully chosen Vans, carrying around their new MacBook Air in a new hiking backpack, with a hydroflask placed carefully in the side. They all fuss about their appearances with their friends, seeking approval, and continually broadcasting photos of themself. These carry the eyes of their peers with them everywhere; one can only wonder at how much effort they spend performing for them.</p>
        <p>There are others, quiet types, those who barely smile. They stare at their schoolwork severely and complete it meticulously. School is like their religion, something never to be challenged; their grades treated with the weight of divine judgments. These, especially, carry a heavy chest of academic expectations, something never to let slip or be dropped.</p>
        <p>But some respond to the academic pressure in a different way. They aren't as reserved; instead, they continually compare themselves with their peers. They rank, measure, and judge everybody around them based on created metrics: GPAs, number of AP classes, and god forbid, even IQ. These carry the achievements of other people with them everywhere, mostly to judge themselves, from which some carry an awkward anxiety.</p>
        <p>Above all, they all carry phones. They are sleek, triple-eyed creatures that silently whisper in their eyes. They are covered in cases, stickers, and wallets. They glimmer, looking new and expensive, and they are always rounded, presenting a less frightening and childlike appearance. Alongside them are bulbous earbuds, sometimes badly worn from their owners flipping them open and closed in meditative fascination. They carry car keys, some for expensive cars. All wield money.</p>
        <p>Crowding like cattle into their chutes, the $92-million-dollar-a-year-school-district dispenses $3.75 government lunches, lunches which each student hurriedly accepts. Their lunches might hold shrunken fruits, three spoonfuls of macaroni, a small carton of milk slick with moisture and tastelessly decorated: these are unaffectedly consumed and discarded. Janitors stare at the mess. Squashed orange. Leaking milk. The school tells each one they are special, but only the students are naive enough to believe it, many carrying a sense of entitlement.</p>
        <p>And yet,</p>
        <p>I love them all, even though I hate them equally. Life is what it is: sometimes overarchingly absurd, which you'll see so too--next time you walk past them in the halls.</p>
